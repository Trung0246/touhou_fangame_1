No. 1 Saline Petrichor

This is the title theme.

It's always like this, isn't it?
This time I tried to capture the smell of rain and put into music.
The world is refreshing after heavy showers. But only when it isn't humid.

No. 2 The Sky Wanders Closer

The stage 1 theme.

It's raaaaining. But it's not really a bleak kind of rain.
It's weird to see fairies in Gensokyo with any half-decent intelligence.
But it doesn't make a difference.

No. 3 Fae Rising From Seafoam

Azure Swirl's theme.

Faerie sounds a lot classier than fairy, so doesn't it sound cool
when you throw it into a song name? What? No?
Her formal speech is on purpose, by the way. (lol)

No. 4 Seeping Through the Blue Canopy

The stage 2 theme.

It's still raining. When it's the rainy season somewhere, you tend
to stay inside a lot more. That's just human nature.
Once when I was a kid, I had to spend a whole week indoors because of a typhoon...

No. 5 Seeping Through the Blue Canopy

Sakkagumi Happyaku's theme.

Wow, gee, her name is a mouthful. But she doesn't speak much.
Nyudo are quite like that. The quiet type, I mean.
...Usually.

No. 6 A Mermaid Chasing a Shrine Maiden's Tail

The stage 3 theme.

Now you're in an ocean. No, it's not that game or something...
The ocean is either horrifically murky or quite beautiful, depending on which level you're at.
I'm talking about the real ocean, but it applies to the Expanse, too.

@bgm
No. 7 Circe Sitting in the Sea Cloud

Saga Kuramu's theme.

She must admit that in the past she's been a nasty. 
They weren't kidding kidding when they called her, well, a witch.
Does her danmaku convey that well?

@bgm
No. 24 Score's Resting Place

Score Input theme.

Lay your score to rest.
This song is both haunting and relieving.
